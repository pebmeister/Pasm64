;   Memory locations 0-255 ($0-$FF) have a special significance in 6502
;   machine language programming (the 6510 microprocessor in the
;   Commodore 64 shares the same instruction set as the 6502). Since
;   these addresses can be expressed using just one byte, instructions
;   which access data stored in these locations are shorter and execute
;   more quickly than do instructions which operate on addresses in
;   higher memory, which require two bytes.
;   Because of this relatively fast execution time, most 6502
;   software makes heavy use of zero-page locations. The 64 is no exception,
;   and uses this area for many important system variables and pointers.
;   In addition, locations 0 and 1 have special Input/Output functions on the 6510.
;   In the case of the 64, this on-chip I/O port is
;   used to select the possible combinations of ROM, as we will see below,
;   and to control cassette I/O.

; 6510 On-Chip I/O DATA Direction Register
; Bit 0: Direction of Bit 0 I/O on port at next address. Default =1 (output)
; Bit 1: Direction of Bit 1 I/O on port at next address. Default =1 (output)
; Bit 2: Direction of Bit 2 I/O on port at next address. Default=l (output)

; Bit 6: Direction of Bit 6 I/O on port at next address. Not used.
; Bit 7: Direction of Bit 7 I/O on port at next address. Not used.
;
; This location is the first of a number of hardware registers.
; Although they can be written to and/or read like RAM,
; they are connected to hardware devices, and their contents affect the
; operation of the devices.
; Each bit of this Data Direction Register determines whether the
; contents of the corresponding bit on the Internal I/O Port (see location 1)
; can be written to by peripheral devices. If the bit is set to 0, it
; indicates the direction of data flow as Input, which means that the
; corresponding bit of the I/O Port will be affected by peripheral devices.
; If the bit is set to 1, it indicates Output. On the 64, only Bits 0-5
; are significant. On power-up, this register is set to 239 ($EF),
; which indicates that all bits, except for Bit 4 (which senses the cassette switch),
; are set up for Output.

;
; R6510         $01
;
; Bit 0: LORAM signal. Selects ROM or RAM at 40960 ($A000). 1 = BASIC, 0=RAM
; Bit 1: HIRAM signal. Selects ROM or RAM at 57344 ($E000). l=Kernal, 0=RAM
; Bit 2: CHAREN signal. Selects character ROM or I/O devices. 1 =I/O, 0=ROM
; Bit 3: Cassette Data Output line.
; Bit 4: Cassette Switch Sense. Reads 0 if a button is pressed, 1 if not.
; Bit 5: Cassette Motor Control. A 1 turns the motor on, a 0 turns it off.
; Bits 6-7: Not connectedâ€”no function presently defined.
;
; The chief function of this register is to determine which blocks of
; RAM and ROM the 6510 microprocessor will address. The Commodore 64
; comes with 64K RAM, even though it normally does not use
; all of that RAM at once. In addition, it has an 8K BASIC Interpreter
; ROM, an 8K Operating System Kernal ROM, a 4K Character Generator
; ROM, a Sound Interface Device (SID), a 6566 Video Interface
; Controller (VIC-II), and two 6526 Complex Interface Adapter chips.
; To address all of these at once would require 88K, 24K past the
; addressing limit of the 6510 microprocessor. In order to allocate
; address space, the I/O Port is used to affect the addressing lines, and
; thus determine which segments of RAM and ROM will be addressed
; at any one time.

;
; This vector points to the address of the BASIC routine which converts
; a floating point number to an integer. In the current Kernal
; version, the address that it points to is 45482 ($B1AA). Disassembly
; of the ROMs indicates that BASIC does not use this vector. However,
; it may be of real assistance to the programmer who wishes to
; use data that is stored in floating point format. The parameter that is
; passed by the USR command is available only in that format, for example.
; Since it is extremely difficult to decipher and use a floating point
; number, the simplest way to deal with such data is to use the conversion
; routines that are built into BASIC to change it into a two byte
; signed integer. This could be accomplished by jumping directly
; into the BASIC ROM, if you know the location of the routine. It is
; preferable to use this vector because it will always point to the location
; of the routine. Therefore, if the address changes in future versions
; of the 64 or future Commodore computers, you won't have to
; modify your program to make it work with them.
; See the entry for the USR vector at 785 ($311) for an explanation
; of how to use this routine in connection with the USR command.

; Vector: Routine to Convert a Number from Integer to Floating Point
; This vector points to the address of the BASIC routine which converts
; an integer to a floating point number. This routine is currently
; located at 45969 ($B391). BASIC does not appear to reference this
; location. It is available for use by the programmer who needs to
; make such a conversion for a machine language program that interacts

;
; CHARAC        $07
;
; Search Character for Scanning BASIC Text Input
; This location and the next are used heavily by the BASIC routines
; that scan the text that comes into the buffer at 512 ($200), in order
; to detect significant characters such as quotes, comma, the colon
; which separates BASIC statements, and end-of-line. The ASCII
; values of such special characters are usually stored here.
; This location is also used as a work area by other BASIC
; routines that do not involve scanning text.

ENDCHAR = $08
; ======================================================================================
;
; ENDCHAR       $08
;
; Search Character for Statement Terminator or Quote

; ======================================================================================

TRMPOS  = $09
; ======================================================================================
;
; TRMPOS        $09
;
; Column Position of the Cursor before the Last TAB or SPC
; TRMPOS is used by TAB and SPC. The cursor column position prior
; to the TAB or SPC is moved here from 211 ($D3), and is used to calculate
; where the cursor ends up after one of these functions is invoked.
; Note that the value contained here shows the position of the
; cursor on a logical line. Since one logical line can be up to two physical
; lines long, the value stored here can range from 0 to 79.
; ======================================================================================

VERCK   = $0A
; ======================================================================================
;
; VERCK         $0A
;
; Flag: LOAD or VERIFY
; BASIC uses one Kernal routine to perform either the LOAD or VERIFY
; function, depending on whether the Accumulator (.A) is set to 0
; or 1 upon entry to the routine. BASIC sets the value of VERCK to 0
; for a LOAD, or 1 for a VERIFY. Its contents are passed to the Kernal
; LOAD routine, which in turn stores it in location 147 ($93).

;
; Index into the Text Input Buffer/Number of Array Subscripts
; The routines that convert the text in the input buffer at 512 ($20b)
; into lines of executable program tokens, and the routines that link
; these program lines together, use this location as an index into the
; input buffer area. When the job of converting text to tokens is finished,
; the value in this location is equal to the length of the
; tokenized line.
; The routines which build an array or locate an element in an array
; use this location to calculate the number of DIMensions called
; for and the amount of storage required for a newly created array, or
; the number of subscripts specified when referencing an array element.

DIMFLG  = $0C
; ======================================================================================
;
; DIMFLG        $0C
;
; Flags for the Routines That Locate or Build an Array
; This location is used as a flag by the routines that build an array or
; reference an existing array. It is used to determine whether a variable
; is an array, whether the array has already been DIMensioned, and
; whether a new array should assume the default dimensions.
; ======================================================================================

VALTYP  = $0D
; ======================================================================================
;
; VALTYP        $0D
;
; Flag: Type of Data (String or Numeric)
; This flag is used internally to indicate whether data being operated
; upon is string or numeric. A value of 255 ($FF) in this location indicates
; string data, while a 0 indicates numeric data. This determination
; is made every time a variable is located or created.
; ======================================================================================

INTFLG  = $0E
; ======================================================================================
;
; INTFLG        $0E
;
; Flag: Type of Numeric Data (Integer or Floating Point)
; If data which BASIC is using is determined to be numeric, it is further
; classified here as either a floating point number or as an integer.
; A 128 ($80) in this location identifies the number as an integer, and
; indicates a floating point number.
; ======================================================================================

GARBFLG = $0F
; ======================================================================================
;
; GARBFLG       $0F
;
; Flag for LIST, Garbage Collection, and Program Tokenization
; The LIST routine uses this byte as a flag to let it know when it has
; come to a character string in quotes. It will then print the string,
; rather than search it for BASIC keyword tokens.
; The garbage collection routine uses this location as a flag to indicate
; that garbage collection has already been tried before adding a
; new string. If there is still not enough memory, an OUT OF MEMORY
; message will result.
; This location is also used as a work byte for the process of converting
; a line of text in the BASIC input buffer (512, $200) into a
; linked program line of BASIC keyword tokens.
; ======================================================================================

SUBFLG  = $10
; ======================================================================================
;
; SUBFLG        $10
;
; Flag: Subscript Reference to an Array or User-Defined Function
; Call (FN)
; This flag is used by the PTRGET routine which finds or creates
; a variable, at the time it checks whether the name of a variable is
; valid. If an opening parenthesis is found, this flag is set to indicate
; that the variable in question is either an array variable or a userdefined function.
; You should note that it is perfectly legal for a user-defined function (FN)
; to have the same name as a floating point variable. Moreover, it
; is also legal to redefine a function. Using a FN name in an
; already defined function results in the new definition of the function.
; ======================================================================================

INPFLG  = $11
; ======================================================================================
;
; INPFLG        $11
;
; Flag: Is Data Input to GET, READ or INPUT?
; Since the keywords GET, INPUT, and READ perform similar functions,
; BASIC executes some of the same instructions for all three.
; There are also many areas of difference, however, and this flag indicates
; which of the three keywords is currently being executed, so
; that BASIC will know whether or not to execute the instructions
; which relate to the areas in which the commands differ (152
; ($98) = READ, 64 ($40)= GET, 0=INPUT).
; As a result, INPUT will show the ? prompt, will echo characters
; back to the screen, and will wait for a whole line of text ended by a
; carriage return. GET gives no prompt and accepts one character
; without waiting. The colon character and the comma are valid data
; for GET, but are treated as delimiters between data by INPUT and
; READ. As each command has its own error messages, this flag is used
; to determine the appropriate message to issue in case of an error.
; ======================================================================================

TANSGN  = $12
; ======================================================================================
;
; TANSGN        $12
;
; Flag: Sign of the Result of the TAN or SIN Function
; This location is used to determine whether the sign of the value re
; turned by the functions SIN or TAN is positive or negative.
; Additionally, the string and numeric comparison routines use
; this location to indicate the outcome of the comparison. For a com
; parison of variable A to variable B, the value here will be 1 if A is
; greater than B, 2 if A equals B, and 4 if A is less than B. If more than
; one comparison operator was used to compare the two variables
; (e.g., >= or <= ), the value here will be a combination of the
; above values.
; ======================================================================================

CHANNL  = $13
; ======================================================================================
;
; CHANNL        $13
;
; Current I/O Channel (CMD Logical File) Number
; Whenever BASIC inputs or outputs data, it looks here to determine
; which I/O device is currently active for the purpose of prompting or
; output control. It uses location 184, $B8 for purposes of deciding
; what device actually to input from or output to.
; When the default input device (number 0, the keyboard) or output
; device (number 3, the display screen) is used, the value here will
; be a zero, and the format of prompting and output will be the standard
; screen output format.
; When another device is used, the logical file number (CMD
; channel number) will be placed here. This lets the system know that
; it may have to make some subtle changes in the way it performs the
; I/O operation. For example, if TAB is used with the PRINT command,
; cursor right characters are used if the device PRINTed to is
; the screen. Otherwise, spaces are output when the number here is
; other than zero (the assumption being that you can't tab a printer
; like you can the screen).
; Likewise, the ? prompt for INPUT is suppressed if the file number
; here is nonzero, as is the EXTRA IGNORED message, and input
; of a carriage return by itself is ignored, rather than being treated as a
; null string (""). Therefore, by OPENing the screen as a device, and
; issuing the CMD statement, you can force the suppression of the ?,
; prompt, and the other effects above.
; CMD places the new output file number here, and calls the
; Kernal to open the device for output, leaving it LISTENing for output
; (such as the READY prompt, which is diverted to the new device).
; Many routines reset this location and UNLISTEN the device, defeating
; the CMD and once again sending output to the screen. If an
; error message has to be displayed, for example, this location will be
; reset and the message will be displayed on the screen. GET, GET#,
; INPUT, INPUT#, and PRINT# all will reset this location after the
; I/O is completed, effectively redirecting output back to the screen.
; PRINT and LIST are the only I/O operations that will not undo the CMD.
; This location can also be used to fool BASIC into thinking that
; data it is reading from the tape is actually being entered into the
; keyboard in immediate mode.
; For a look at a technique that uses a different approach to accomplish
; the same thing for disk or tape users, see location 512
; ($200), the keyboard buffer.

LINNUM  = $14
; ======================================================================================
;
; LINNUM        $14
;
; Integer Line Number Value
; The target line number for GOTO, LIST, ON, and GOSUB is stored
; here in low-byte, high-byte integer format, as is the number of a
; BASIC line that is to be added or replaced.
; LIST saves the highest line number to list (or 65535â€”$FFFF if
; program is to be listed to the end) at this location. < 1
; GOTO tests the target line number to see if it is greater than the
; line number currently being executed. If it is greater, GOTO starts its
; search for the target line at the current line number. If it is not J
; greater, GOTO must search for the target line from the first line of
; the program. It is interesting to note that the test is of the most
; significant byte only. Therefore, INT (TARGETLINE/256) must be
; greater than INT(CURRENT LINE/256) in order for the search to
; start with the current line, instead of at the beginning of the
; program. PEEK, POKE, WAIT, and SYS use this location as a pointer to
; the address which is the subject of the command.

;
; Pointer to the Next Available Space in the Temporary String Stack
; This location points to the next available slot in the temporary string
; descriptor stack located at 25-33 ($19-$21). Since that stack has room
; for three descriptors of three bytes each, this location will point to 25
; ($19) if the stack is empty, to 28 ($1C) if there is one entry, to 31
; ($1F) if there are two entries, and to 34 ($22) if the stack is full.
; If BASIC needs to add an entry to the temporary string descriptor

;
; LASTPT        $17
;
; Pointer to the Address of the Last String in the Temporary String Stack
