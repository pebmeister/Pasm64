; Relocatable code stub for Supermon 64 by Jim Butterfield
; This code was disassembled from the original Supermon+64 V1.2 binary.

; The relocation stub starts at the Start of Variables pointer (VARTAB) and
; works backwards through the Supermon64 machine code, copying it to the top
; of basic memory pointer (MEMSIZ), and decrementing the pointer as it goes.
; Relative addresses that need to be adjusted are marked with a $36 byte
; immediately following them. Since we're working backwards, the marker is
; encountered first, then the high byte, then the low byte of the address
; needing to be adjusted. The relative addresses are calculated such that
; adding the top of memory to them will yield the absolute address of the
; jump target in the relocated code.

; build.py will build a relocatable Supermon64 binary from this stub plus
; standard Supermon64 binaries assembled to two different pages.
